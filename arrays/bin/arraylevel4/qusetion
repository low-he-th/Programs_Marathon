Calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array:

Problem: We're given an array of integers, and we want to find the sum of all its elements.

Approach: We will iterate through the array and add each element to a "sum" variable. By the time we've looked at every element in the array, our "sum" variable will contain the total sum of all elements in the array.

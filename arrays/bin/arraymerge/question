Calculate the sum of corresponding elements of an array and store in a 3rd array:

Problem: We're given two arrays of the same size, and we want to create a third array such that each element in this array is the sum of the corresponding elements in the first two arrays.

Approach: We will create a third array that is the same size as the first two arrays. We'll then go through a for loop where we add the corresponding elements of the first two arrays and store the result in the third array.

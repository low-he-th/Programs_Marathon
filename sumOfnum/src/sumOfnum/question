Problem: We are given a positive integer N by the user.
 Our task is to calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers and print it out.
 Natural numbers are simply numbers that you naturally count, i.e., 1, 2, 3, and 
 so on.

For example, if N is 5, we want to calculate the sum 1+2+3+4+5, which equals 15.

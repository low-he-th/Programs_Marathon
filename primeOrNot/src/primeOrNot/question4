Problem: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The task is to check whether a number entered by the user is prime or not.

Approach: We'll start by checking if the number is less than 2; if it is, it's not a prime number. Then, we'll check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number (since a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked). If we find any number that divides, we'll conclude that the number isn't prime. If no such number is found, it's prime.
